NER problem solution with BERT model.
1) Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ramybaly/conll2012
2) Model weights: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z9sPBrd9TakjYU_eIQXDH0BdSweioq5d?usp=drive_link <br/>
   If you want to use weights from google drive download them and specify paths to them in the cell in the beginning of the notebook:<br/>

   If you want to train on your device and do not want to load prepared weights, set those variables from the screenshot above to None.
3) Before running notebook run:<br/>
   pip install -r requirements.txt<br/>
   Requirements file is so big because pip freeze was made in google colab env.
